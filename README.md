# react-minigraph

This project has been heavily inspired by [react-sparklines](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-sparklines). Originally I thought of refreshing that project, but I reckon I recoded it pretty fast and I had fun doing it.

I also wanted to improve on it so here were my goals:

-   Using latest libs (react 17 in particular)
-   s/webpack/parcel/g
-   Have the graphs use the available space and do away with specifying width
-   typescript please
-   curved lines

What I have in mind for this project:

-   Multiple datasets
-   More visualisations
-   Make it an actual project with tests and all

So not exactly done yet, but if you want to play with it:

```bash
yarn install
yarn dev
```

And you'll have [the available graphs](https://pitilezard.github.io/react-minigraph/)
